Genie is a part clone, part improvement on the popular music lyric website Genius. I have always had a passion for music and a lot of love for the Genius website, but I always desired the ability to do more with the information their website has. I used the shazham API on RapidAPI to get access to all the data necessary for this project including the credits of the song, the lyrics of the song, and various other pieces of information.

Some notable features that both Genius and Genie have includes: The ability to search for songs and their lyrics, the ability to see who created the song, the genre(s) of the song, the ability to create a profile that gets saved into a database, and the ability to log back in once you have created a profile.

Some features Genie has that Genius does not have: The ability to create, read, update, and destroy folders for holding songs, for example users can create a folder dedicated to your favorite band and your favorite songs of theirs. In order for folders to function properly Users can save specific songs and add them to said folders, users can also remove these songs from their folders if they choose.

This project is still a work in progress which I am continually improving and using as a platform to hone my skill in both backend and frontend programming.
